# Cats-vs-dogs
In this project we try to solve the most basic question of ML that is classification of cats or dogs.
We first try to classify the cats and dogs on the basis of CNN and then we do the same using using image augmentation also
We notice how image augmentation helps us in not overfitting the data
The framework usedin this project is tensorflow and keras
You can run the code in google colab.
Retraining the whole model will take quite few time so keepin this in mind we also provide the pretrained model in this repository you can use this model to test real world data
## To test on your own data
  You can retrain the whole model or download the load provided in this repository with the name:
    a) cats-v-dogs.h5
    b) cats-v-dogs-weight.h5 and network.json
   You can the scroll to the end and run the cell with file upload
   You can upload the model.h5 file there and then run the next cell to upload the model
   You can run the next cell and upload your custom pics of cat and dog to make prediction.
